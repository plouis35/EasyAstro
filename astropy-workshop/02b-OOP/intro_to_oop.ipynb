    "# Object-oriented programming\n",
    "\n",
    "You've heard that Python is _objected-oriented_, but haven't found a reason to use an object yourself. Here we'll develop an example where designing an object makes life easier. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you've got a series of 1000 light curves, each of which contain: \n",
    "* times\n",
    "* fluxes\n",
    "* uncertainties\n",
    "* flags\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of managing a bunch of arrays to handle these values, we could instead create an object to store light curves. \n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">\n",
    "<em>Aside</em>: this tutorial will guide you through creating your own Python object to represent a light curve. The code shared here is meant as an incomplete pedagogical tool. If you work with light curves in your research, we encourage you to check out advanced existing packages for accomplishing the tasks demonstrated briefly in this notebook, and much much more, like the <strong>lightkurve</strong> package (<a href=\"https://docs.lightkurve.org/\">docs</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/lightkurve/lightkurve\">code</a>).\n",

    "## Defining a new object\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a new object, you use the `class` command, rather than the `def` command that you would use for functions,\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class LightCurve:\n",
    "```\n",
    "We've named the new object LightCurve - object names in python should be uppercase without underscores separating words (whereas functions are usually all lowercase and words are separated by underscores). The `object` in parentheses is the class that `LightCurve` inherits from. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Historical Note:* Sometimes you'll see classes defined like this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class LightCurve(object):\n",
    "```\n",
    "this was required in Python 2, but because all modern Python uses Python 3, it's becoming less common. In Python 3 this is exactly equivalent to `class LightCurve:` so you can effectively ignore it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `__init__` method\n",
    "Now we will define how you call the `LightCurve` constructor (the call that creates new `LightCurve` objects). Let's say you want to be able to create a light curve like this...\n",
    "```python\n",
    "new_light_curve = LightCurve(times=times, fluxes=fluxes, \n",
    "                             uncertainties=uncertainties, flags=flags)\n",
    "```\n",
    "All Python objects get initialized with a function called `__init__` defined within the class, like this: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "class LightCurve:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, times=None, fluxes=None, uncertainties=None, flags=None):\n",
    "```\n",
    "You define the `__init__` function like all other functions, except that the first argument is always called `self`. This `self` is the shorthand variable that you use to refer to the `LightCurve` object within the `__init__` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Attributes\n",
    "Objects have _attributes_, which are like variables stored on an object. We'll want to store the values above into the `LightCurve` object, each with their own attribute, like this: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "class LightCurve:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, times=None, fluxes=None, uncertainties=None, flags=None):\n",
    "        self.times = times\n",
    "        self.fluxes = fluxes\n",
    "        self.uncertainties = uncertainties\n",
    "        self.flags = flags\n",
    "        \n",
    "```\n",
    "Each attribute is defined by setting `self.<attribute name> = <value>`. All attributes should be defined within the `__init__` method. \n",
    "\n",
