    "### Why a New Data Format\n",
    "\n",
    "Astronomy has long had a standard format called FITS (Flexible Image Transport System) created in 1981.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Metadata based on 80 character cards (remnants of punch cards era)\n",
    "  - Limits size of keyword names to 8 characters; values and comments must fit on the rest of the card.\n",
    "- Structure of file consists of a list of header/binary items, however:\n",
    "  - More complex organization must be by convention or using nonstandard extensions\n",
    "  - Astronomical data sets continue to become more complex\n",
    "- The specific motivation for developing the standard was that FITS WCS conventions proved unusable for raw HST data that included complex distortion models and required high accuracy. The experience with HST showed that those conventions will not work with the much more complex JWST WCS transforms.\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "The issues with FITS have been documented in a paper by B. Thomas, et al. (Learning from FITS: Limitations in use in modern astronomical research, Astron. Comput. (2015), 10.1016/j.ascom.2015.01.009, arXiv:1502.00996v2).\n",

    "### Main Features of ASDF\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- It has a hierarchical metadata structure, made up of basic dynamic data types such as strings, numbers, lists and mappings.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Attribute names and values are not constrained by size as is the case for FITS header cards.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It has human-readable metadata that can be edited directly in place in the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The structure of the files can be automatically validated using associated schema files.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It’s designed for extensibility: new conventions may be used without breaking backward compatibility with tools that do not understand those conventions. Versioning systems are used to prevent conflicting with alternative conventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The binary array data (when compression is not used) is a raw memory dump, and techniques such as memory mapping can be used to efficiently access it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is possible to read and write the file in as a stream, without requiring random access.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It’s built on top of industry standards, such as YAML and JSON Schema to take advantage of a larger community\n",
    "working on the core problems of data representation. This also makes it easier to support ASDF in new programming languages and environments by building on top of existing libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Since every ASDF file has the version of the specification to which it is written, it will be possible, through careful planning, to evolve the ASDF format over time, allowing for files that use new features while retaining backward compatibility with older tools."
